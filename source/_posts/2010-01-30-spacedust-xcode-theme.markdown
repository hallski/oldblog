title: Spacedust Xcode Theme

I decided it was time to create a new Xcode theme and created one that works well with dark backgrounds. It's called _Spacedust_ and should look good on most dark tints.

Feel free to grab it if you like it.

<a href="/files/Spacedust.xccolortheme.zip" onClick="javascript: pageTracker._trackPageview('/files/Spacedust.xccolortheme.zip');">Spacedust.xccolortheme.zip</a>

To install it, simply unpack it and place `Spacedust.xccolortheme.zip` in: 
`~/Library/Application Support/Xcode/Color\ Themes`.
