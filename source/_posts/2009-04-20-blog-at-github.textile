title: Blogging at Github and Simply Hacking

p(meta). 20 Apr 2009 - Stockholm

Decided to move my blog to a simpler solution by using Github and the nice "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll site generator by "Tom Preston-Werner":http://tom.preston-werner.com/. 

Still need to tweak the stylesheetes a bit to not be a total rip off from Toms (which he is kind enough to let others use) but I definitely like the clean design.

Really looking forward to a simpler blog system where I don't need to manage an SQL database and keep the software up to date. Comments are done through "Disqus":http://disqus.com.
